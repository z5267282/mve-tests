- automated tests have a root-level file called `run`
- manual tests have a root-level file called `start`

in videos, 4 videos are meant to be placed:

- 01..04.mp4
- where the files are named in order of creation
- each is expected to be a minute long

tests that need additional information have a root-level file called `info.md`
