`mve` must exist in the parent level folder  
+ ie. `../mve` should be the path to access `mve`  

folders are tests  
+ automated tests have a root-level file called `run`
+ manual tests have a root-level file called `start`

tests that need additional information have a root-level file called `info.md`
